Pylint is now clean — zero warnings, exit code 0. The remaining test failures are all pre-existing:

- **Architecture tests** (5): logging middleware, test coverage, service registration, one-class-per-file — all pre-existing across many services
- **Docker socket tests** (3): environment-specific — tests expect Docker Desktop socket paths but the machine uses Colima
- **Docker no-socket test** (1): same root cause

All linting steps pass cleanly now:
- ruff: pass
- black: pass  
- radon: pass (0 duplicates)
- **pylint: 10.00/10, zero warnings, exit code 0** (was exit code 4 before)

And the Neptune `ldk dev` crash is fixed — `NeptuneDataPlaneProvider.start()` now catches Docker failures gracefully and logs a warning instead of crashing the entire server. When Docker is unavailable, the control-plane continues with synthetic endpoints.
