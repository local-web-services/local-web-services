Everything is working. Here's a summary of what was completed:

**Architecture test fix verified:**
- Fixed the path resolution bug in `test_provider_feature_e2e_coverage.py` — `_TESTS_ROOT` now correctly resolves to `tests/` and paths are relative to it
- Added 25 missing internal test keywords to `_INTERNAL_TESTS` (for cognito, dynamodb, eventbridge, lambda, sns, sqs, stepfunctions)
- Confirmed the test **passes** when all feature files are present
- Confirmed the test **fails** when a feature file is removed (e.g., `binary_payloads.feature` → detects `apigateway/binary` as missing)

**Full verification:**
- `make format` — no changes needed
- `make check` — 2285 tests pass, pylint 10/10, 0 duplicates, all lint clean
