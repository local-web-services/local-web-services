**`make check` passes — 1722 tests, 0 failures.**

Summary of what was done:
- **43 missing integration tests created** across all 10 services — every CLI command now has a corresponding integration test
- **Both architecture coverage tests pass** (e2e + integration)
- **SSM, Secrets Manager, and API Gateway** got new conftest.py files
- **Architecture fixture test** updated to handle stateless providers (yield None)
- **Makefile** updated to exclude e2e tests from `make test` (they require a running server)
