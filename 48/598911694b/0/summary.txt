All 1657 tests pass. Two fixes applied:

1. **`routes.py`**: Added `await compute.start()` in `_create_function` so the Docker client is initialized when Terraform creates Lambda functions
2. **`docker.py`**: Function environment variables (like `QUEUE_URL` from Terraform) are now also rewritten from `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` to `host.docker.internal`, same as SDK env vars

Restart `ldk dev`, re-run `terraform apply`, then try `./test-orders.sh` again.
