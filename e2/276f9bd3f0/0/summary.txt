Migration complete. Here's a summary:

**What was done:**
- Merged step definitions from `steps/*.py` back into `conftest.py` for all 20 services
- Deleted all 20 `steps/` directories
- Removed 4 architecture tests from `test_bdd_pattern.py` that enforced the steps/ pattern
- Removed the steps/ exemption from `test_file_naming.py`
- Updated `contributing/testing/END_TO_END.md` to document the simpler conftest.py pattern
- Fixed special cases: lambda_ (subprocess/pytest imports, Docker checks, fixtures), SNS (helper functions, shared dicts), stepfunctions (JSON constants)

**Verification:** `make check` (2240 passed), `make test-e2e` (226 passed)

Regarding your Allure Report request — that's a separate feature. Would you like me to plan an implementation for adding Allure Report support to the project? I can look into what's needed (pytest-allure plugin, configuration, CI integration, etc.).
