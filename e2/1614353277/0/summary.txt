Everything works correctly:

- **E2E test passes** — all 65 e2e test files found in the correctly-named directories
- **Integration test fails as expected** — 43 missing integration tests (only 22 out of 65 exist so far)
- **All 40 existing integration tests pass** after the renames

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Renamed directories** in both `tests/e2e/` and `tests/integration/`:
   - `s3/` → `s3api/`
   - `cognito/` → `cognito_idp/`
   - `eventbridge/` → `events/`

2. **Rewrote architecture test** to be fully convention-based:
   - Removed `_CLI_NAME_TO_TEST_DIR` mapping entirely
   - Removed `_MODULE_TO_CLI_NAME` mapping entirely
   - Now parses `lws.py` with AST to auto-discover `app.add_typer(..., name="<cli_name>")` calls and their corresponding service modules
   - Directory naming convention: `cli_name.replace("-", "_")`
   - File naming convention: `test_{command.replace("-", "_")}.py`

3. **Updated `contributing/testing/END_TO_END.md`** to reference `tests/e2e/s3api/` instead of `tests/e2e/s3/`
