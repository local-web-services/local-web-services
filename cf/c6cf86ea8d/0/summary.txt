All passing:
- `make check`: **2240 passed**
- `make test-e2e`: **226 passed**, 227 allure result files generated

Here's a summary of everything done:

**Steps migration:**
- Merged step definitions from `steps/*.py` into `conftest.py` for all 20 services
- Deleted all `steps/` directories
- Removed 4 architecture tests enforcing the steps/ pattern
- Removed the steps/ exemption from `test_file_naming.py`
- Updated `END_TO_END.md` documentation

**Allure Report integration:**
- Added `allure-pytest-bdd` dependency for BDD e2e tests
- `make test-e2e` now writes Allure results to `allure-results/`
- `make allure-report` generates and opens the HTML report locally
- Added `allure-results` and `allure-report` to `.gitignore`
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
  - `test-e2e` job uploads allure results as an artifact
  - New `allure-report` job generates the report, publishes to GitHub Pages on main, and posts a summary comment with pass/fail counts on PRs
