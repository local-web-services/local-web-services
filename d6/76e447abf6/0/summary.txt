All tests pass. The fix was that the E2E test was using `/_ldk/invoke` (via `lws lambda invoke` CLI) which looks up functions in the CDK-parsed `compute_providers` dict. But in Terraform mode, functions are created via the Lambda management API (port + 9) and stored in a separate `LambdaRegistry`. 

I updated the test to invoke the Lambda directly through the Lambda management API's invocations endpoint (`/2015-03-31/functions/{name}/invocations`), which is the correct path since that's where the function was registered.

Regarding your comment about `/_ldk/invoke` — you're right that nothing should be using it in this test context. The function was created on the Lambda management API, so invoking should go through that same API. The `/_ldk/invoke` endpoint only knows about functions parsed from CDK cloud assemblies, not ones created dynamically via the Lambda management REST API.
