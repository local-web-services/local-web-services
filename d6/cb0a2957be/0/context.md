**Commit Message:** Do you need to update contributing/LINTING.md and the makefile

## Prompt

do you need to update contributing/LINTING.md and the makefile ?

## Summary

The Makefile was already updated earlier in this session (`make test` now runs `uv run pytest --ignore=tests/e2e`). The LINTING.md now matches — shows the correct command and explains the e2e exclusion.
