All 45 tests pass. Here's a summary of the S3 virtual-hosted-style fix (two layers of defense):

**Layer 1 — Force path-style in the container** (`src/lws/providers/lambda_runtime/docker.py` + new `aws_config`):
- Created `src/lws/providers/lambda_runtime/aws_config` — a shared AWS config file that forces path-style S3 for both Node.js SDK (v2/v3) and Python boto3
- Set `REDACTED` in the container env (the bootstrap dir is already mounted)
- This prevents the DNS resolution issue entirely — the SDK will use `host.docker.internal:3003/bucket-name/...` instead of `bucket-name.host.docker.internal:3003/...`

**Layer 2 — Server-side middleware** (`src/lws/providers/s3/routes.py`):
- Added `_VirtualHostRewriteMiddleware` that detects virtual-hosted-style requests (bucket name in `Host` header subdomain) and rewrites the path to path-style
- This handles edge cases where requests DO reach the server with virtual-hosted style (e.g., non-Docker clients, custom DNS setups)

Restart `ldk dev` and the S3 DNS error should be resolved.
