Done. Here's what changed:

- **Pre-commit hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`): Now runs `make test-e2e` after `make check`
- **CI** (`ci.yml`): Added `test-e2e` as a 4th parallel job
- **Publish** (`publish.yml`): Added `test-e2e` as a 4th parallel job; `build` now depends on it
- **LINTING.md**: Added section 7 for e2e tests, updated check count and descriptions
