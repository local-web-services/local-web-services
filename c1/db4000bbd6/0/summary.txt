The web GUI `request_body` will now show:

```json
{
  "event": { "httpMethod": "POST", "body": "...", ... },
  "context": {
    "function_name": "ProcessOrderFunction",
    "memory_limit_in_mb": 128,
    "timeout_seconds": 30,
    "aws_request_id": "abc-123",
    "invoked_function_arn": "arn:aws:lambda:..."
  }
}
```

Regarding containers not exiting — the `subprocess.run` approach uses `docker exec -i` which pipes stdin then closes it. When stdin closes, the Node.js `fs.readFileSync('/dev/stdin')` gets EOF. But the Node process still hangs if there are active SDK connections and the installed `invoker.js` doesn't have our `process.exit(0)` fix.

Have you reinstalled the package from the source tree since we changed `invoker.js`? The mounted bootstrap files come from the installed package location. You can verify by checking which `invoker.js` is actually being used:

```bash
python3 -c "from lws.providers.lambda_runtime.docker import _BOOTSTRAP_DIR; print(_BOOTSTRAP_DIR)"
```

If it points to the pipx install path, you need to reinstall:

```bash
pipx install --force /Users/eamonnfaherty/Development/github.com/local-web-services/local-web-services
```
