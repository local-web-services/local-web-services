Feature: LambdaOpensearch - A "Lambda" "Function" Is Deployed

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_opensearch.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, DocumentRequiresExistingIndex, IndexRequiresActiveDomain

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @deploy_function
  Scenario: a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Given the "lambda" "function" did not already exist
    When a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Then the "lambda" "function" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "function" invocation references an "ACTIVE" "lambda" "function"
    And every "INDEXED" "opensearch" "document" belongs to an existing "opensearch" "index"
    And every existing "opensearch" "index" belongs to an "ACTIVE" "opensearch" "domain"

  @guard @negative @deploy_function
  Scenario: a "lambda" "function" is deployed fails when the "lambda" "function" already existed
    Given the "lambda" "function" already existed
    When a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Then the operation is rejected
