  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_sqs.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresEnabledESM, InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, MessagesReferenceActiveQueues, ESMReferencesActiveQueue

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @deploy_function
  Scenario: a Lambda function is deployed
    Given the function does not already exist
    When a Lambda function is deployed
    Then the function is "ACTIVE"
    And every in-progress invocation was initiated by an "ENABLED" event source mapping
    And every in-progress invocation references an "ACTIVE" Lambda function
    And every "AVAILABLE" or "IN_FLIGHT" message belongs to an "ACTIVE" queue
    And every "ENABLED" event source mapping references an "ACTIVE" queue

  @standard @negative @deploy_function
  Scenario: a Lambda function is deployed fails when the function already exists
    Given the function already exists
    When a Lambda function is deployed
    Then the operation is rejected
