  # Generated from FizzBee spec: apigateway_cognito.fizz
  # Safety invariants: AuthorizerRequiresActivePool, AuthorizedRequestRequiresValidToken, AuthorizedRequestRequiresPoolMembership, RejectedRequestHasMismatchedPool

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_user_pool
  Scenario: a "cognito" "user pool" is created
    Given the "cognito" "user pool" did not already exist
    When a "cognito" "user pool" is created
    Then the "cognito" "user pool" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "API" with a configured authorizer references an "ACTIVE" pool
    And every "AUTHORIZED" request was validated against a "VALID" token
    And every "AUTHORIZED" request's token belongs to a "cognito" "user" in the "api gateway" "API"'s configured pool
    And every "REJECTED" request's token belongs to a "cognito" "user" in a different pool than the configured authorizer

  @guard @negative @create_user_pool
  Scenario: a "cognito" "user pool" is created fails when the "cognito" "user pool" already existed
    Given the "cognito" "user pool" already existed
    When a "cognito" "user pool" is created
    Then the operation is rejected
