Feature: LambdaSns - A "Lambda" "Function" Is Deployed

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_sns.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, PublishRequiresActiveTopic

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @deploy_function
  Scenario: a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Given the "lambda" "function" did not already exist
    When a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Then the "lambda" "function" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "function" invocation references an "ACTIVE" "lambda" "function"
    And "sns" publishing requires an "ACTIVE" "sns" "topic" to be present

  @guard @negative @deploy_function
  Scenario: a "lambda" "function" is deployed fails when the "lambda" "function" already existed
    Given the "lambda" "function" already existed
    When a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Then the operation is rejected
