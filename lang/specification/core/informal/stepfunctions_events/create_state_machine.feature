Feature: StepfunctionsEvents - A Step Functions State Machine Is Created

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: stepfunctions_events.fizz
  # Safety invariants: ExecutionRequiresActiveStateMachine, DeliveredEventReferencesExistingExecution

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a Step Functions state machine is created
    Given the state machine does not already exist
    When a Step Functions state machine is created
    Then the state machine is "ACTIVE" with no EventBridge bus configured
    And every "RUNNING" execution references an "ACTIVE" state machine
    And every "DELIVERED" event references an execution that exists

  @standard @negative @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a Step Functions state machine is created fails when the state machine already exists
    Given the state machine already exists
    When a Step Functions state machine is created
    Then the operation is rejected
