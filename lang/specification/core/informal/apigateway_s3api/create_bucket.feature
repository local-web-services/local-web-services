  # Generated from FizzBee spec: apigateway_s3api.fizz
  # Safety invariants: ObjectReferencesExistingBucket, SuccessfulRequestReferencesExistingAPI

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_bucket
  Scenario: a "s3" "bucket" is created
    Given the "s3" "bucket" did not already exist
    When a "s3" "bucket" is created
    Then the "s3" "bucket" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every existing object references a "s3" "bucket" that exists
    And every successful request references an "api gateway" "API" that exists

  @guard @negative @create_bucket
  Scenario: a "s3" "bucket" is created fails when the "s3" "bucket" already existed
    Given the "s3" "bucket" already existed
    When a "s3" "bucket" is created
    Then the operation is rejected
