Feature: S3api - The List Of Buckets Is Retrieved

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: s3api.fizz
  # Safety invariants: BucketStatusValid, VersioningStateValid, MultipartUploadStatusValid, DeleteBucketRequiresEmpty

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @list_buckets
  Scenario: the list of buckets is retrieved
    When the list of buckets is retrieved
    Then the available buckets are returned
    And every bucket has a valid status ("ACTIVE" or "DELETED")
    And every bucket versioning state is valid ("DISABLED", "ENABLED", or "SUSPENDED")
    And every multipart upload has a valid status ("IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED", or "ABORTED")
    And deleting a bucket requires it to be empty
