Feature: Dynamodb - All Tables Are Listed

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: dynamodb.fizz
  # Safety invariants: TableStatusValid, GsiPendingNonNegative, TransactionStatusValid, TransactionTableExists, ItemsOnlyInActiveTables, DeletedTableNotWritable

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @list_tables
  Scenario: all tables are listed
    When all tables are listed
    Then the list of tables is returned
    And every table has a valid status ("CREATING", "ACTIVE", or "DELETED")
    And "GSI" pending write count is never negative
    And transaction status is always a valid value
    And a pending transaction always references an existing table
    And items only exist in non-deleted tables
    And deleted tables are never the target of a pending transaction
