Feature: LambdaEvents - An "Eventbridge" "Bus" Is Created

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_events.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, PublishedEventReferencesExistingBus

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_event_bus
  Scenario: an "eventbridge" "bus" is created
    Given the "eventbridge" "bus" did not already exist
    When an "eventbridge" "bus" is created
    Then the "eventbridge" "bus" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "function" invocation references an "ACTIVE" "lambda" "function"
    And every "PUBLISHED" "eventbridge" "event" references a "eventbridge" "bus" that exists

  @guard @negative @create_event_bus
  Scenario: an "eventbridge" "bus" is created fails when the "eventbridge" "bus" already existed
    Given the "eventbridge" "bus" already existed
    When an "eventbridge" "bus" is created
    Then the operation is rejected
