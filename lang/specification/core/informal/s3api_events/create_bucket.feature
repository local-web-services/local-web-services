  @minimal @happy @create_bucket
  Scenario: a "s3" "bucket" is created
    Given the "s3" "bucket" did not already exist
    When a "s3" "bucket" is created
    Then the "s3" "bucket" will be "ACTIVE" with no EventBridge notification configuration
    And every "DELIVERED" "eventbridge" "event" references an "s3" "object" that exists
    And every "DELIVERED" "eventbridge" "event" references a "eventbridge" "bus" that exists

  @guard @negative @create_bucket
  Scenario: a "s3" "bucket" is created fails when the "s3" "bucket" already existed
    Given the "s3" "bucket" already existed
    When a "s3" "bucket" is created
