Feature: LambdaStepfunctions - A "Step Functions" "State Machine" Is Created

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_stepfunctions.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, RunningExecutionReferencesExistingStateMachine

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a "step functions" "state machine" is created
    Given the "step functions" "state machine" did not already exist
    When a "step functions" "state machine" is created
    Then the "step functions" "state machine" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" invocation references an "ACTIVE" Lambda function
    And every "RUNNING" execution references a state machine that exists

  @guard @negative @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a "step functions" "state machine" is created fails when the "step functions" "state machine" already existed
    Given the "step functions" "state machine" already existed
    When a "step functions" "state machine" is created
    Then the operation is rejected
