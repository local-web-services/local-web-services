Feature: LambdaStepfunctions - A Step Functions State Machine Is Created

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_stepfunctions.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, RunningExecutionReferencesExistingStateMachine

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a Step Functions state machine is created
    Given the state machine does not already exist
    When a Step Functions state machine is created
    Then the state machine is "ACTIVE"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" invocation references an "ACTIVE" Lambda function
    And every "RUNNING" execution references a state machine that exists

  @guard @negative @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a Step Functions state machine is created fails when the state machine already exists
    Given the state machine already exists
    When a Step Functions state machine is created
    Then the operation is rejected
