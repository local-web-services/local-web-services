Feature: LambdaStepfunctions - A "Step Functions" "State Machine" Is Created

  # Generated from FizzBee spec: lambda_stepfunctions.fizz
  # Safety invariants: InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, RunningExecutionReferencesExistingStateMachine

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a "step functions" "state machine" is created
    Given the "step functions" "state machine" did not already exist
    When a "step functions" "state machine" is created
    Then the "step functions" "state machine" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "function" invocation references an "ACTIVE" "lambda" "function"
    And every "RUNNING" "step functions" "execution" references a "step functions" "state machine" that exists

  @guard @negative @create_state_machine
  Scenario: a "step functions" "state machine" is created fails when the "step functions" "state machine" already existed
    Given the "step functions" "state machine" already existed
    When a "step functions" "state machine" is created
    Then the operation is rejected
