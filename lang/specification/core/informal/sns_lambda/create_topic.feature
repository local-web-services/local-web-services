  @minimal @happy @create_topic
  Scenario: a "sns" "topic" is created

    And every "CONFIRMED" "sns" "subscription" references an "ACTIVE" "sns" "topic"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "function" invocation references an "ACTIVE" "lambda" "function"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "invocation" was triggered by a "CONFIRMED" "sns" "subscription"
