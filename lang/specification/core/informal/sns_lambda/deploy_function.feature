  # Generated from FizzBee spec: sns_lambda.fizz
  # Safety invariants: SubscriptionReferencesActiveTopic, InvocationRequiresActiveFunction, InvocationRequiresConfirmedSubscription

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized

  @minimal @happy @deploy_function
  Scenario: a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Given the "lambda" "function" did not already exist
    When a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Then the "lambda" "function" will be "ACTIVE"
    And every "CONFIRMED" "sns" "subscription" references an "ACTIVE" "sns" "topic"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "function" invocation references an "ACTIVE" "lambda" "function"
    And every "IN_PROGRESS" "lambda" "invocation" was triggered by a "CONFIRMED" "sns" "subscription"

  @guard @negative @deploy_function
  Scenario: a "lambda" "function" is deployed fails when the "lambda" "function" already existed
    Given the "lambda" "function" already existed
    When a "lambda" "function" is deployed
    Then the operation is rejected
